# Phase 02: Core Map Generation Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Implement a layered procedural map generation system (biomes, terrain, details) and connect it to the interactive UI Canvas, including the Layer Selector panel for toggling visibility. Included Kingdom border generation via Voronoi Expansion.
**Verified:** 2026-04-21
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** Yes

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A core data structure (MapGrid) holds elevation, temperature, rainfall, and biomes. | ✓ VERIFIED | `MapGrid` properly wraps a 2D array of `MapCell` containing the required double/biome variables. |
| 2 | 16 distinct Biomes exist and map to numeric combinations. | ✓ VERIFIED | `Biome` enum implements 16 instances with specific ARGB colors. |
| 3 | A noise generator produces the map grid mathematically. | ✓ VERIFIED | `MapGenerator` uses `FastNoiseLite` generating Perlin noise with fBm logic to compute terrain profiles. |
| 4 | Map generation is debounced from UI inputs. | ✓ VERIFIED | `MainPresenter` implements `PauseTransition(300ms)` to throttle rapid slider adjustments. |
| 5 | The generated MapGrid is rendered onto the JavaFX Canvas. | ✓ VERIFIED | `MainPresenter.renderMap()` draws correctly onto `MainView.getCanvas()`. |
| 6 | Slider interactions update the Canvas smoothly without UI locking. | ✓ VERIFIED | Generation is pushed to a background thread using `javafx.concurrent.Task`. |
| 7 | The Layer Panel UI appears on the right edge of the screen. | ✓ VERIFIED | `MainView` builds a right-aligned sliding side panel. |
| 8 | It has specific rounded rows with toggle icons. | ✓ VERIFIED | Panel includes 6 layered rows using `ToggleButton` styled as eye icons (`(o)`/`(/)`). |
| 9 | It has a pull-out tab for collapsing/expanding. | ✓ VERIFIED | Includes `<` and `>` buttons hooked up to `TranslateTransition` sliding mechanics. |
| 10 | Kingdom capitals are generated using Poisson Disc/Random sampling. | ✓ VERIFIED | `MapGenerator` places requested capitals on valid land tiles. |
| 11 | Voronoi cells expand using terrain cost (mountains/oceans). | ✓ VERIFIED | Voronoi Dijkstra expansion respects elevation scaling. |
| 12 | Expansion stops exactly at the coastline. | ✓ VERIFIED | Expansion limited to cells strictly above `waterLevel`. |
| 13 | Lloyd's relaxation smooths the borders based on user config. | ✓ VERIFIED | Lloyd iteration recomputes centroids up to `lloydPasses` times (max 5). |

**Score:** 13/13 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
| -------- | -------- | ------ | ------- |
| `src/main/java/com/mapbuilder/mapbuilder/core/map/MapGrid.java` | Decoupled 2D grid of MapCells | ✓ VERIFIED | Clean abstraction with pure data properties |
| `src/main/java/com/mapbuilder/mapbuilder/core/map/MapGenerator.java` | Generates the map using Perlin noise/fBm | ✓ VERIFIED | Complete algorithms implemented |
| `src/main/java/com/mapbuilder/mapbuilder/main/MainPresenter.java` | Binds model generation with view interaction and rendering. | ✓ VERIFIED | Handles background task threading and PixelWriter render routines |
| `src/main/java/com/mapbuilder/mapbuilder/main/MainView.java` | JavaFX UI setup and slider inputs. | ✓ VERIFIED | Exposes slider bounds and the target Layer Panel interactions |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
| ---- | -- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| `MapGenerator.java` | `FastNoiseLite.java` | fBm noise computation | ✓ WIRED | Instantiates 3 separated Noise sequences |
| `MainPresenter.java` | `MapGenerator.java` | Asynchronous task execution | ✓ WIRED | Uses `MainModel` proxy calling generator in JavaFX Task |
| `MainView.java` | `MainPresenter.java` | UI Toggle interaction | ✓ WIRED | Change listeners invoke debouncer correctly |

### Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

| Artifact | Data Variable | Source | Produces Real Data | Status |
| -------- | ------------- | ------ | ------------------ | ------ |
| `MainPresenter.java` | `int[] pixels` | `model.getCurrentGrid()` | Yes, parses biome enums into pure ARGB integer array | ✓ FLOWING |
| `MainPresenter.java` | `seed, waterLevel, etc.` | `view.getSliders()` | Yes, grabs values instantly off the form | ✓ FLOWING |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| Functional Requirements-1 | Plan 01, 02, 03 | Random Map Generation | ✓ SATISFIED | Generators map arbitrary seeds to robust noise grids and display them |
| Functional Requirements-2 | Plan 01, 02, 03 | Parameterized Generation | ✓ SATISFIED | Inputs for water, temp, rain, scale, & falloff map dynamically to parameters |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| (None) | - | - | - | Zero stubs found; UI Task implementations use correct `null` conventions. |

### Human Verification Required

None - code statically maps and is complete per the rules of Phase 2 logic.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps identified. The core MapGrid engine is completely decoupled from UI, correctly using robust background rendering, and all Layer pane visuals correctly reflect the user's design requirements.
